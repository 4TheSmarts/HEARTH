| H009        | Attackers may exploit mshta.exe, a trusted Windows utility, to execute malicious .hta files as well as JavaScript or VBScript indirectly. Mshta.exe is designed to run Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA) files, which are stand-alone applications that operate independently of the browser but use the same frameworks and technologies as Internet Explorer. This utility's trusted status can make it a valuable tool for adversaries seeking to evade detection and execute code stealthily. | Defense Evasion | Data requirements: Windows Sysmon, EDR telemetry, Proxy logs | #DefenseEvasion #SystemBinaryProxyExecutionMshta | [Azrara](https://github.com/Azrara)

## Why

- Hunting for malicious mshta.exe activity provides critical early detection of potential threats by targeting a commonly exploited Windows utility that attackers use to evade security defenses.
- This hunt improves threat visibility, enhances detection accuracy, and mitigates the risk of full-scale attacks by catching adversaries in the early stages.
