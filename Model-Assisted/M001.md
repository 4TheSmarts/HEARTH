## Why

- ML identifies unusual login patterns, such as unusual times, locations, or device types, which are strong indicators of account takeover attempts.
- By learning from recent login data, ML can adapt to detect sophisticated attacks, like credential stuffing or lateral movement, that might evade static detection rules.
- Compare current login behaviors against personalized user baselines and find potential compromise.
