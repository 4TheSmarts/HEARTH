| H008 | Adversaries may create domain accounts to maintain access to systems with Active Directory. | Persistence | Domain Accounts can cover user, administrator, and service accounts. | #Persistence #ActiveDirectory | [Audra Streetman](https://x.com/audrastreetman) |

## Why  

- Domain accounts "may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system," according to MITRE ATT&CK.
- Empire, PsExec, Pupy, and Net (net user /add /domain) are examples of tools, utilities and frameworks that can create a new domain user, if permissions allow.
- This technique has been used by adversaries such as Sandworm in the 2015 and 2016 attacks targeting Ukraine's electric grid, and also in attacks attributed to the cybercriminal group Wizard Spider.  

## Next Steps  

- Monitor newly executed processes associated with account creation, such as net.exe.
- Monitor for newly created user accounts through Window Event IDs, such as 4720.
