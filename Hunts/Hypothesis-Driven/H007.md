| H007    | After compromising a host, adversaries may attempt to execute malicious commands to complete additional tasks. | Execution | Adversaries often abuse legitimate command interpreters/applications, such as CMD, PowerShell, or bash/zsh. | #execution #sus | [Jamie Williams](https://x.com/jamieantisocial) |

## Why

- Adversaries often abuse accessible terminal/shell applications to execute post-compromise tasks
- Malicious command execution may be identifiable by characteristics of the:
  - command (e.g., `whoami` or other rare [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0007/) activity) as well as attempts to obfuscate executed commands ([T1027.010 - Obfuscated Files or Information: Command Obfuscation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/010/))
  - user/host (e.g., does`{person}` in `{department}` ever execute admin commands like this?)
  - command/process lineage (e.g., why are `PowerShell.exe` processes spawning from Outlook...?)

- Malicious commands may also be executed from script files, so consider also investigating newly created files ([T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105/)) referenced in suspicious commands
- **Note:** Consider baselining and comparing instances of suspicious command execution against known false positives (e.g., [WTFBins](https://wtfbins.wtf/))
