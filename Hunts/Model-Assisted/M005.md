# M005

Machine learning models can detect command-line obfuscation via Base64 encoding, which adversaries may use to evade detection.

| M005 | Machine learning models can detect command-line obfuscation via Base64 encoding, which adversaries may use to evade detection. | Defense Evasion | Adversaries can use Base64 encoded commands and scripts in a variety of interpreters, such as PowerShell, Windows Command Shell, and Bash. | #DefenseEvasion #Obfuscation | [Audra Streetman] (https://x.com/audrastreetman) |

## Why  

- Encoded commands and scripts are more difficult to signature and analyze. 
- Machine learning models can detect and decode Base64 commands, flag unusually long commands, and detect commands that match patterns of obfuscation. 
- A number of adversaries have used Base64 to obfuscate commands and scripts, including APT19, Wizard Spider, and Fox Kitten. It is also a feature of remote access tools such as ComRAT and DarkWatchman.
