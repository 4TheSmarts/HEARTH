        # Welcome to the HEARTH Forge! üî®
        This space is for developing early-stage threat hunting ideas. Unlike full HEARTH submissions,
        Forge ideas don't need to be fully tested or documented - they're a starting point for
        collaboration and refinement.
        
        ‚ö†Ô∏è For completed, tested hunt methodologies, please use the HEARTH Hunt Submission Form instead.

        ## When to Graduate to Full HEARTH Submission
        Your Forge idea may be ready for a full HEARTH submission when:
        - You have a clear, testable hypothesis
        - The detection methodology is documented and repeatable
        - You've validated the approach in at least one environment
        - You can provide concrete examples and use cases
        - The technique provides actionable results

        When ready, submit your matured idea through the HEARTH Hunt Submission Form!
