## Idea Development Methods

### 1. Current Events Analysis
- Monitor news for security incidents
- Study published incident reports
- Review disclosed vulnerabilities
- Track threat actor campaigns

### 2. Internal Intelligence
- Review past security incidents
- Analyze failed attack attempts
- Study successful compromises
- Examine detection gaps

### 3. Data-Driven Approach
- Audit available data sources
- Identify unexplored data sets
- Review logging coverage
- Map detection capabilities

## Idea Refinement Process

### 1. Initial Capture
- Document basic concept
- Note relevant data sources
- List potential techniques
- Record references

### 2. Research Phase
- Gather supporting evidence
- Find similar approaches
- Document limitations
- Identify requirements

### 3. Validation Questions
- Is the idea testable?
- Are data sources available?
- What tools are needed?
- Is it practically implementable?

## Converting to HEARTH Submission

### 1. Determine Hunt Type
- **Flames** (Hypothesis-Driven)
  - Clear adversary behavior
  - Specific activity patterns
  - Testable hypothesis
- **Embers** (Baseline)
  - Normal behavior patterns
  - Environmental baselines
  - Deviation detection
- **Alchemy** (Model-Assisted)
  - Algorithm requirements
  - Data science approach
  - Pattern recognition

### 2. Documentation Requirements
- Complete hypothesis statement
- Supporting references
- Implementation details
- Required resources

### 3. Submission Preparation
- Use official template
- Include all references
