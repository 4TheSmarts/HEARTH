# ⚡ Threat Hunter Operational Repository (THOR) ⚡

<img src="/THOR_logo.png" alt="THOR Logo" width="400"/>

A database of threat hunting ideas generated by the community with common metadata to assist others in various types of threat hunts and serve as a central repository for vetted hunting concepts.

It incorporates ideas for **three distinct types** of hunts classified by the [PEAK Threat Hunting Framework](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-threat-hunting-framework.html):
- Hypothesis-Driven
- Baseline (AKA Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA)
- Model-Assisted Threat Hunts (M-ATH)

## 🔨 Why 
Generating effective hypotheses and ideas for threat hunting is hard. Sharing ideas and methodologies for different types of hunts can enhance our collective capabilities and make us all better.

## 🔨 Goals 
- Encourage collaboration
- Inspire threat hunters with practical and theoretical hunting ideas

## 🔨 How to Contribute to THOR 

We welcome contributions to the Threat Hunter Operational Repository! There are two primary ways you can contribute:

### ⚡ 1. Submit a Hunt Idea 
Share your threat hunting ideas with the community by following these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your submission.
4. **Use the [Hunt-Template.md](/Templates/Hunt-Template.md)** to guide your submission. This template helps ensure that your hunt idea is well-structured and aligned with THOR.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Submissions must follow sequential numbering** for the hunt types:
> - Hypothesis-Driven: H0001, H0002, H0003, etc.
> - Baseline: B0001, B0002, B0003, etc.
> - Model-Assisted: M0001, M0002, M0003, etc.
> 
> Make sure to check the latest hunt numbers in the repository before assigning your own. Custom hunt numbers will not be assigned, and your hunt must follow the next available number (e.g., H002 must follow H001).

5. **Add your hunt idea** to the appropriate folder.
6. **Commit your changes** and push them to your forked repository.
7. **Create a pull request** from your branch to the main repository.

Your submission will be reviewed by the maintainers, and upon approval, you'll receive a credited hypothesis number and a threat hunting sticker!

### ⚡ 2. Report Bugs and Request New Features
Help us improve THOR by reporting bugs or suggesting new features:

- **Submit an issue** on the GitHub repository by clicking [submitting an issue](https://github.com/triw0lf/THOR/issues/new/choose) and filling out the provided template.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>**Accepted submissions will get a threat hunting sticker and a credited hunt number (like H0001).**

### ⚡ **THOR is open source and community-developed. We encourage everyone interested in contributing to check out these resources and join our community of threat hunters!**⚡

## 🔨 Templates 

The primary template for contributing to **THOR** is the **[Hunt-Template.md](/Templates/Hunt-Template.md)**. This is the core tool for submitting your hunt ideas and contributing to the community-driven repository. It’s designed to help you document and share hypothesis-driven, baseline, or model-assisted hunts.

### Bonus Tools:
- **[Hunt-Generation.md](/Templates/Hunt-Generation.md)**: Once you've got your idea, use this to plan out your hunt in detail.
- **[Hunt-Review.md](/Templates/Hunt-Review.md)**: After your hunt, use this to capture all key findings and ensure nothing is missed when sharing your results.

## 🔨 THOR's Forge 🔨
Got a half-baked idea or something that still needs work? Submit it to **THOR's Forge**, where we collect and refine early-stage threat hunting ideas.

- Browse [THOR's Forge](/Forge/)
- Contribute your unfinished ideas using the [Forge Idea Template](/Forge/Hunt-Idea-Template.md).

<!--
THOR Hypothesis Review Board Prospectus

The review board will be comprised of 5-7 individuals who will review all hypothesis submissions and vote on acceptance into the THL. 

All submissions will be piped in to a communication channel (Slack? Ugh I don’t want another one but maybe) or email to make review easy and acceptance or denial seamless. 

New versions of the THOR will be published on a monthly (quarterly?) basis and all reviews must be completed 72 hours prior to release date. Any rejection should have comments on why it is being rejected and if potential improvements can be made for acceptance. 

Unanimous acceptance of the hypothesis must be achieved by the review board for publication. 

Review board members are expected to spread the word about THOR on socials or other channels.
