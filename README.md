# Threat Hunter Operational Repository (THOR) 🏹

## Abstract
A database of threat hunting ideas generated by the community with common metadata to assist others in various types of threat hunts and serve as a central repository for vetted hunting concepts.

It incorporates ideas for **three distinct types** of hunts classified by the [PEAK Threat Hunting Framework](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-threat-hunting-framework.html]):
- Hypothesis-Driven
- Baseline (AKA Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA)
- Model-Assisted Threat Hunts (M-ATH)

## Why
Generating effective hypotheses and ideas for threat hunting is hard. Sharing ideas and methodologies for different types of hunts can enhance our collective capabilities and make us all better.

## Goals
Inspire threat hunters
