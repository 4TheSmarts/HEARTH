# Threat Hunter Operational Repository (THOR) 🏹

A database of threat hunting ideas generated by the community with common metadata to assist others in various types of threat hunts and serve as a central repository for vetted hunting concepts.

It incorporates ideas for **three distinct types** of hunts classified by the [PEAK Threat Hunting Framework](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/peak-threat-hunting-framework.html]):
- Hypothesis-Driven
- Baseline (AKA Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA)
- Model-Assisted Threat Hunts (M-ATH)

## Why
Generating effective hypotheses and ideas for threat hunting is hard. Sharing ideas and methodologies for different types of hunts can enhance our collective capabilities and make us all better.

## Goals
- Encourage collaboration
- Inspire threat hunters

## How to Contribute to THOR

We welcome contributions to the Threat Hunter Operational Repository! There are two primary ways you can contribute:

### 1. Submit a Hunt Idea
Share your threat hunting ideas with the community by following these steps:

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine.
3. **Create a new branch** for your submission.
4. **Add your hunt idea** in the designated file.
5. **Commit your changes** and push them to your forked repository.
6. **Create a pull request** from your branch to the main repository.

Your submission will be reviewed by the maintainers, and upon approval, you'll receive a credited hypothesis number and a threat hunting sticker!

### 2. Report Bugs and Request New Features
Help us improve THOR by reporting bugs or suggesting new features:

- **Submit an issue** on the GitHub repository by clicking [submitting an issue](https://github.com/triw0lf/THOR/issues/new/choose) and filling out the provided template.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>**Accepted submissions will get a threat hunting sticker and a credited hypothesis number (like H0001).**

### **THOR is open source and community-developed. We encourage everyone interested in contributing to check out these resources and join our community of threat hunters!**

<!-- need to clarify the Submission Process

- **Format Requirements:** Outline what information should be included in each submission (e.g., hypothesis, methodology, expected outcomes, etc.).
- **Review Process:** Briefly describe the process for how submissions will be reviewed and vetted.

add some sort of Community section

Encourage engagement by creating a section that highlights how to get involved:

- Join the Discussion: Link to a forum, Slack, or Discord channel where threat hunters can discuss ideas.
- Contribute: Outline other ways to contribute beyond submitting ideas, such as reviewing others' submissions or sharing resources.

Social Media and Outreach

- Encourage sharing on social media using a specific hashtag? or just sharing in general
- How do people provide feedback?

## Templates

Not sure where to start?
Take a hunt hypothesis/topic and use the [Hunt Generation template]([/Templates/Hunt-Generation.md) to plan your hunt!

Once you finish your hunt, use the [Hunt Review template](/Templates/Hunt-Review.md) to share all your findings!

THOR Hypothesis Review Board Prospectus

The review board will be comprised of 5-7 individuals who will review all hypothesis submissions and vote on acceptance into the THL. 

All submissions will be piped in to a communication channel (Slack? Ugh I don’t want another one but maybe) or email to make review easy and acceptance or denial seamless. 

New versions of the THOR will be published on a monthly (quarterly?) basis and all reviews must be completed 72 hours prior to release date. Any rejection should have comments on why it is being rejected and if potential improvements can be made for acceptance. 

Unanimous acceptance of the hypothesis must be achieved by the review board for publication. 

Review board members are expected to spread the word about THOR on socials or other channels.
