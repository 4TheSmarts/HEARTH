| M004         | Machine learning models can identify database query anomalies indicating potential data manipulation or exfiltration activity. | Impact | If a user or system executes an unusually high number of data modification queries (e.gl, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) within a short timeframe, particularly in sensitive databases, it may indicate potential data manipulation or exfiltration activities.  | #impact #machinelearning  |  [John Grageda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngrageda/) 

## Why

- Data manipulation, including unauthorized changes or deletions, can be a sign of insider threats or external attacks.
- A significant increase in the number of database modification queries (e.g., more than 100 modifications in an hour).
- Modifications occurring in critical or sensitive database tables that typically have restricted access.
- Database queries being executed by users who do not usually interact with those tables or databases.
- Execution of queries that do not align with normal business operations (e.g., mass deletions or updates).
