Machine learning models can identify anomalies with user or systems initiating outbound traffic with unusually large byte sizes that may indicate potential data exfiltration activity.

| M003         | Machine learning models can identify anomalies with user or systems initiating outbound traffic with unusually large byte sizes that may indicate potential data exfiltration activity. | Exfiltration | Unusual Byte Size: Outbound packets significantly larger than the typical size associated with normal business transactions. | #exfiltration #machinelearning |  [John Grageda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngrageda/) 

## Why

- Data exfiltration is a significant threat where sensitive information is transferred outside the organization. 
- Analyzing byte sizes of outbound traffic can help detect unusual patterns that may indicate unauthorized data transfer.
- Correlate unusual byte sizes and spikes in outbound traffic volume during non-standard business hours focusing on file extensions known for containing sensitive information.
