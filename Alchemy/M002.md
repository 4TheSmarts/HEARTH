Beaconing behavior can be detected in encrypted DNS traffic patterns by applying machine learning models that identify anomalous, periodic communication indicative of command and control activity.

| M002         | Beaconing behavior can be detected in encrypted DNS traffic patterns by applying machine learning models that identify anomalous, periodic communication indicative of command and control activity. | Command and Control | Encrypted DNS traffic (e.g., DoH) may be used to hide beaconing communications, making it harder to detect. | #commandandcontrol #beaconing #dns #machinelearning |  [Sydney Marrone](https://x.com/letswastetime) 

## Why

- Detect hidden beaconing activities by analyzing patterns in encrypted DNS traffic that deviate from typical usage.
- Apply machine learning models to identify anomalies in encrypted DNS traffic, such as regular, periodic connections that suggest beaconing.
- Enhance detection capabilities for encrypted communications channels that attackers may exploit to hide their C2 activities.
