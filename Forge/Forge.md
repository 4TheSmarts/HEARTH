# ðŸ”¨ The HEARTH Forge

Welcome to the HEARTH Forge - where rough ideas are hammered into powerful threat hunting techniques!

## What is the Forge?

The Forge is HEARTH's developmental workspace, designed for:
- Workshopping early-stage hunting ideas
- Collaborative refinement of detection techniques
- Experimental approaches that need community input
- Building bridges between theoretical concepts and practical implementation

Think of the Forge as your threat hunting workshop - a place to experiment, fail fast, learn, and iterate with the support of the community.

## When to Use the Forge

Submit to the Forge when:
- You have an interesting idea but aren't sure how to implement it
- You've noticed a pattern that might be worth hunting
- You need community input on technical feasibility
- You want to explore innovative detection approaches
- You're learning threat hunting and want guidance

## How is the Forge Different from Main HEARTH Submissions?

| Aspect | Forge Submissions | HEARTH Hunt Submissions |
|--------|------------------|------------------------|
| Stage | Early development | Fully formed methodologies |
| Focus | Innovation and exploration | Structured hunt procedures |
| Requirements | Basic concept outline | Detailed documentation |
| Format | Flexible, emphasis on ideas | Standardized templates |
| Goal | Shape and develop concepts | Share complete methodologies |
| Community Role | Active collaboration & feedback | Implementation & refinement |

## The Forge Process

1. **Submit**: Share your idea using the Forge template
2. **Collaborate**: Engage with community feedback and suggestions
3. **Iterate**: Refine your approach based on input
4. **Test**: Try out your developing technique
5. **Graduate**: When ready, submit as a full HEARTH hunt
