# âš¡ THOR: Threat Hunter Operational Repository âš¡

## THOR's Forge ðŸ”¨
Welcome to **THOR's Forge**, where we collect and shape threat hunting ideas that are still in the early stages of development. Just like how Thorâ€™s hammer, [MjÃ¶lnir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir), was forged in a mythical workshop, this is where our ideas are crafted, refined, and readied for battle.

Feel free to contribute your own unfinished ideas or help us hammer out and flesh out existing ones!

- Submit your own using the [Forge Idea Template](/Forge/Forge-Idea-Template.md)
