## Why

- A successful attack usually means legitimate DLLs or functions are abused, or malicious adversary-supplied DLLs are executed
- Objectives may be accomplished on payload installation/execution, credential theft, or broader goals such as data theft
- Associated with QakBot, APT28, APT29, Lazarus Group, and many more
