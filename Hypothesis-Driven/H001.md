## Why

- The admin account on an externally facing VPN gateway provides significant control over network access, making it a prime target for adversaries.
- Successful brute force attacks on this account could lead to unauthorized access to the internal network, bypassing other security controls.
- Brute force attempts on the VPN gateway may be part of a larger campaign targeting critical infrastructure, necessitating immediate investigation and response.
