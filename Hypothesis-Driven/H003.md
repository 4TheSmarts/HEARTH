| H003         | An adversary has exfilitrated data off backup servers into small (1MB) .zip files.  | Exfiltration | Attackers often need to get data out, 1MB chunks sneak beneath big file anomaly detection. Consider different file sizes and types based on normal in your environment. | #exfiltration     |

## Why

- Adversaries often need to take data in order to extort companies for money.
- Data transfer limits and monitoring are effective controls for stopping malware, data loss, and other nefarious activities. 
- Breaking data up into small chunks sticks below transfer limits, and using .zip files allows adversaries to blend in with normal traffic.
