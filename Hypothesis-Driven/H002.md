## Why

- Identify non-approved or malicious EDRs used by threat actors for persistence, surveillance, or launching internal attacks.
- Fill gaps in monitoring by proactively searching for artifacts and signals that standard tools might miss, improving detection of potential threats.
- Uncover and stop attackers from repurposing legitimate EDRs or deploying fraudulent instances for malicious purposes.
