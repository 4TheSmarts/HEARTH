## Why

- .bash_profile, .bashrc, .bash_login scripts execute when a user opens a cli or connects remotely. 
- .bash_logout (if it exists) scripts execute when a user exits a session or logs ourt of an interactive login shell session like SSH. 
-  Often used by IT Administrators to execute scripts at user logon
