| B001         | Unusual spikes in outbound network traffic over port 443 may indicate unauthorized data exfiltration. | Command and Control, Exfiltration      | Establishing normal traffic patterns to detect deviations | #baseline #networktraffic #anomalydetection |

## Why

- Port 443 is commonly used for legitimate HTTPS traffic, making it an attractive channel for attackers to hide data exfil activities within encrypted traffic.
- By using a well-known port like 443, adversaries can blend malicious traffic with normal traffic, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional security controls.
- Spikes in traffic over port 443 can signal an exfil attempt, as attackers may try to move data through encrypted channels that are less scrutinized.
